When developing multiplayer games with [Amazon GameLift](https://aws.amazon.com/gamelift/), games developers usually integrate their games with Amazon GameLift before deciding how to test the more complex features such as matchmaking, and server scaling. Since testing game servers across fleets of elastic instances requires complex orchestration of virtual players, itâ€™s often hard to understand how best to configure Amazon GameLift, meaning its often left until late in the game development cycle.

The Amazon GameLift Testing Toolkit helps games developers to quickly test, visualize, and optimize their multiplayer games. 

It automatically detects GameLift deployments, and provides a real-time view of player activity, letting users trial different designs, and quickly identify bugs and inefficiencies. This makes it easier to troubleshoot, debug, and tune your Amazon GameLift infrastructure.

Coupled with the optional capability to launch virtual players running the same game code as real players, the Amazon GameLift Testing Toolkit gives game developers certainty their launch will be successful.
